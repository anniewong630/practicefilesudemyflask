        subdomain1.site.com != subdomain2.site.com

top-level-domain: .com, .net, .biz, ... (DNSs control these and point them to all websites in the public-facing internet)

Path/route: the part after the server address and port that specifies the type of info you are sending or requesting
Query: the section denoted by the '?' in the URL. This is where you pass publicly-visible data to the server
        (think of these as variable names and their corresponding values)

        This is most used with web pages that have lots of sections (check out almost any github repo's README)
